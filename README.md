#Author: Jaswinder Singh, Kanwalvir Singh Dhindsa,Jaiteg Singh</br>
Attached ZIP in the repository named software.zip, Contains two folders of CodeLevelSecusriy Software, one before applying Reengineering and other after applying Reengineering.ZIP File also having a word file containing classes source code that have been used in the research work for quality improvement. Word file contains source code of classes before and after updating that is before applying reengineering process and source code after performing re-engineeering. Both the software versions have been executed in NetBeans Platform. </br>
Chidamber and Kemerer Metric( CK Metric) tool CKJM-1.9 is applied to the software before and after performing reengineering to get metric values of Coupling Between Object (CBO),Depth of the Inheritance Tree(DIT), Number of Children (NOC), Response for a Class (RFC), Lack of Cohesion of Methods (LCOM) and Weighted Methods per Class (WMC).
